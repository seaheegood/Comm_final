          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently attending
            <a href="https://www.georgiancollege.ca/">Georgians College</a>. I
            was interested in programming, and I was able to work as a front-end
            developer in Korea. While working, I found out that I needed more
            professional knowledge and English skills, so I decided to enter
            Georgians College. I am living very busy every day because I am
            conducting school classes and language studies at the same time. But
            all the studies are very fun, and I can see that my skills improve,
            so I feel very proud and motivated. Now that I'm used to many
            things, I'm planning my own side projects and putting them into
            practice. I try to solve coding problems whenever I have time on
            sites such as Hackerrank and write development journals so that I
            don't waste my spare time. Whenever I work with my friends to
            complete group projects, do personal projects, and solve problems, I
            am very happy and fun to do these things. I want to be a person who
            learns new knowledge and skills and creates many things through them
            and solves problems that I keep facing. On a personal note, I enjoy
            watching sports games and I'm a big fan of Arsenal. I like not only
            watching but also exercising. I also enjoy taking pictures very
            much, and I think it's very valuable to capture the view I saw on
            camera while traveling.

        <p>
          Once again, hi! Besides coding, I like to take pictures while
          traveling. The pictures below are the ones I took myself during my
          trip to New York

        <h4>Tutorial: How to Take Good Photos</h4>
        <p>
          Taking good photos is an art that anyone can master with a little
          practice and some useful tips. In this beginner's guide, we'll walk
          you through the steps to capture stunning images with your camera or
          smartphone. Let's get started!
        </p>

        <div class="projects-wrapper">
          <div>
            <h5>Step1: Understanding Lighting</h5>
            <img src="" alt="" />
            <p>
              The most important factor in taking a picture is light. If the
              subject you want to take is against the light, it is difficult to
              produce good results. If you understand the direction and amount
              of light and use it properly to take pictures, you are more likely
              to take good pictures.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Step2: Trying a New Angle</h5>
            <p>
              The way to make your picture special is to capture the point of
              looking at the world with a new perspective. An unfamiliar angle
              that others have not come up with will make your picture more
              special.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Step3: Use Editing</h5>
            <p>
              While capturing a great photo is essential, some post-processing
              can enhance the final result. Be cautious not to over-edit, but
              consider Crop, Exposure, and Color Correction. It is rare to see
              any photographer who does not use an editing program.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Step4: Tell a Story</h5>
            <p>
              Stories are one of the most powerful ways we can appeal to
              ourselves. If you add a story to your picture, it will become more
              special and powerful.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h5>Sep5: Get a Camera</h5>
            <p>
              With cell phone photography technology so advanced today, you
              won't feel the need to buy a separate camera. But the moment you
              buy a camera and go outside with it, you'll see the whole world
              from a photographer's perspective. Maybe a picture taken with a
              cell phone is prettier, but you can pledge your willingness to
              capture your gaze by using a camera.
